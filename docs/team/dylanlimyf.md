# Dylan Lim - Project Portfolio Page

## Overview
Crypto1010 is a CLI blockchain wallet simulator for learning concepts such as wallet creation, transfers, validation, and persistence.

My main scope was evolving the app from basic single-user wallet operations into a multi-account system with authenticated sessions, account-scoped persistence, and cross-account transfers. I also contributed early wallet-management commands and later transfer-flow refinements.

### Enhancements implemented
- Implemented the early wallet-management foundation before the package rename from `seedu.duke` to `seedu.crypto1010`, including the `Wallet` model, `WalletManager`, `ListCommand`, and `BalanceCommand`.
- Tightened command parsing and validation by enforcing the `n/` prefix for `create`, the `w/` prefix for `balance`, and rejecting wallet names with spaces.
- Added `history` to display outgoing wallet transaction history.
- Extended `SendCommand` with Bitcoin and Solana address support, clearer insufficient-balance handling, improved self-transfer and balance-calculation behavior, and a fix so manual fee override correctly bypasses speed validation.
- Refactored transfer execution into `TransactionRecordingService` to separate command parsing from transaction-recording logic.
- Implemented authenticated multi-account support through `AuthenticationService`, `PasswordHasher`, `AccountStorage`, and account-scoped wallet/blockchain storage.
- Implemented `CrossSendCommand` and `CrossAccountTransferService` for transfers between wallets owned by different authenticated accounts.
- Added `LogoutCommand` so users can end the current session and switch accounts without restarting the application.

### Contributions to testing
- Added or expanded automated tests for `AuthenticationService`, account-scoped storage, `CrossSendCommand`, `HistoryCommand`, `LogoutCommand`, `SendCommand`, `CreateCommand`, `ListCommand`, and `BalanceCommand`.
- Used tests to lock down parser changes and transfer edge cases such as insufficient balance, invalid wallet names, self-transfer behavior, and fee override handling.

### Contributions to the User Guide
- Documented startup authentication and account-scoped persistence behavior.
- Added and updated command usage for `crossSend`, `history`, `logout`, and wallet-related command formats after parser changes.
- Updated examples, FAQ entries, and data-storage notes to reflect the multi-account model.
- Fixed User Guide table-of-contents and PDF anchor links so sections such as Quick Start, Startup Authentication, Command Summary, Data and Persistence, and FAQ navigate correctly.

### Contributions to the Developer Guide
- Added implementation details for authentication, account-scoped storage, and `crossSend`.
- Documented wallet currency tagging, `history`, wallet persistence, and the transfer-recording design around `TransactionRecordingService`.
- Updated the guide with account-switching design notes and command implementation guidance for future contributors.

### Contributions to team-based tasks
- Helped align command, storage, and transfer layers as the project moved from single-user behavior to authenticated multi-account sessions.
- Kept tests and documentation in sync with behavior changes across wallet creation, transfer history, cross-account transfer, and logout/account switching.
- Contributed project documentation updates for the User Guide, Developer Guide, About Us page, and team portfolio materials.
